# run-mc-server
Python script for running and automatically updating a minecraft server. Supports Windows/Mac/Linux, and requires Python 3.x.

# Instructions
Place script in a blank directory (to start a new server) or an existing minecraft directory. Run it with:

"python run-mc-server.py"
(might need to use "python3 run-mc-server.py" if you have python 2 installed as well)

TODO: Add ability to enter commands manually from the console to the server.
